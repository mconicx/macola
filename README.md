Macola
======

This repository is currently undergoing major refactoring due to the original repository's license restrictions.

---

Macola is a fork of the open-source alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource engine, https://github.com/LogicAndTrick/sledge.
It is written in .NET and uses [Veldrid][2] for rendering, with DirectX 10. Alternative/additional technologies will be listed here in time whenever necessary.

The idea behind my fork of Sledge is to improve the editor, fix some bugs, but mainly add more features such as custom compatibility with other file formats that may be user-defined.
My main goal of this editor is to add multi user support through servers, where people can use the editor together from different computers.
